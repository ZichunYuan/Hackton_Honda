# OHI/O Hackathon_Honda
This was the project accomplished in HackOHI/O 2020 within 48 hours and was for competing in the Honda challenge.

We built a data-driven application using Android Studio that enables individual car owners to maximize the useful value of their mobility investment.

Firstly we built an interactive user interface to acquire the vehicle information from the user.

Then we used open source  https://www.themoneycalculator.com/vehicle-finance/calculators/car-depreciation-by-make-and-model/

By utilizing data from the open source, we developed a model of vehicle value based on make, model, and built-year. We showed the vehicle value in the form of chart and graph.
