# OHI/O Hackathon_Honda
This was the project accomplished in HackOHI/O 2020 within 48 hours and was for competing in the Honda challenge.

We built a data-driven application using Android Studio that enables individual car owners to maximize the useful value of their mobility investment.

Firstly we built an interactive user interface to acquire the vehicle information from the user.

Then we used open source  https://www.themoneycalculator.com/vehicle-finance/calculators/car-depreciation-by-make-and-model/

By using Mathematica, we were able to extract useful data from the open source. Then we developed a model of vehicle value based on make, inital purchased price, and built-year. We showed the vehicle value in the form of chart and graph.
