# Hackton_Honda
This is the project accomplished in HackOHI/O 2020 and is for competing in the Honda challenge.

We built a data-driven application using Android Studio that enables individual car owners to maximize the useful value of their mobility investment.

Firstly we wrote a graphic user interface to acquire the vehicle information from the user, and then calculated the vehicleâ€™s value with our algorithm.  We are able to build an interactive graphic user interface to provide the information as a graph to provide an explicit visualization for our user.

Used open source  https://www.themoneycalculator.com/vehicle-finance/calculators/car-depreciation-by-make-and-model/

By utilizing data from the open source, we developed a model of vehicle value based on make, model, and built-year.
