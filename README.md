# Hackton_Honda
This is the project accomplished in HackOHI/O 2020 and is for competing in the Honda challenge.

We built a data-driven application using Android Studio that enables individual car owners to maximize the useful value of their mobility investment.

Firstly we built an interactive user interface to acquire the vehicle information from the user, and then calculated the vehicleâ€™s value with our algorithm.  We showed the vhecile value in the form of chart and graph.

By utilizing data from the open source, we developed a model of vehicle value based on make, model, and built-year.
